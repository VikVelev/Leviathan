Leviathan is an interactive web application, where you can travel back in time by selecting a year via an intuitive user interface. 
You get a map in the state which corresponds to the chosen year, and get additional information about a chosen area 
(state/country/continent). The main goal of this web app is digitizing history, making teaching and learning history fun and mostly 
it's about making history accessible to everyone with a browser. It is built using d3.js,node.js and MongoDB and should be able to 
run on any computer/tablet/phone (doable).
